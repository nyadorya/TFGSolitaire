<h1>What is a transformation game?</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Transformation games will bring you an understanding and change in your own life. <br>
Transformation games let you experience your life and experience, past experiences and insights. <br>
Throughout the game you can learn important lessons that you can understand more about your personal strengths and understand how you will work at the physical, emotional, spiritual and spiritual levels. <br>
Also, the game can be used as a powerful "interactive tool" in both individuals and groups to solve problems and achieve hope. <br>
By providing new perspectives on the current life issues, it helps to clarify the old beliefs and attitudes and changes the pattern of reactions. <br>
The transformation game will bring out your creativity and will make your power and possibilities real. <br>
</p>

<h1>Game flow</h1>
<hr>
<p>
The rough flow is as follows.
</p>
<p>
Start game -> Life pass -> End game <br>
You can end the game at any time. <br>
The goal of the game is to finish all four levels ('Physical', 'Emotional', 'Mental', 'Spiritual'). <br>
However, there are scenes where you have to end the game in the middle of the road due to too much pain. In that case, it will be your strength if you look back on why the pain you have held has increased. <br>
</p>

<h1>Start game</h1>
<hr>
<p>
What to do at the start of the game is as follows.
<li> Focus determination
<li> Create an unconscious envelope
<li> Nativity
<li> Guardian angel determination
<li> Determination of heading direction
</p>
<h2>Focus decision </h2>
<p>
Decide one focus (for specific personal problems or tasks you want to solve) to do the transformation game. <br>
By concentrating on focus within the game, you will clearly understand the problems and tasks you want to solve and provide a new direction for your life. <br>
By playing games, you will reach the core of the problem and gain a deeper experience. <br>
Personal focus is important, and you need to select actions during the game according to your personal focus during the game. <br>
</p>

<p>
The following is an example of focus. </br>
Of course, personal focus can be decided by yourself, not by the example below. </br>
<li> How can we eliminate work stress?
<li> What steps should be taken to get more happiness and satisfaction?
<li> What kind of barriers in yourself should be removed in order to live a joyful, creative, harmonious life?
<li> How do you spend your time doing more work and feeling better?
<li> How can we earn wealth?
<li> I want to identify and eliminate barriers to gain trust.
<li> I want to be able to behave like a "certain" person.
<li> How to obtain work-life balance to enjoy life more.
<li> What obstacles should be removed to keep receiving all services from space?
</p>

<h2>Create an unconscious envelope</h2>
<p>
I will put an angel, insight, setback that you potentially have in the game into an unconscious envelope. Decide the number of sheets to shake by swinging the dice.
</p>

<h2>birth</h2>
<p>
At the beginning of the game you will be born in the game world. Sometimes born in peace, there are things that are not so.
</p>

<h2>Guardian angel decision</h2>
<p>
We decide an guardian angel to protect you who was born at the same time as birth. Choose from unconscious envelopes.
</p>

<h2>Determination of moving direction</h2>
<p>
As I am born, I get down to the life path I will take from now, but I can choose which way to go.
And for that choice, the first luck try is waiting.
<li> If it succeeds, go to the selected direction.
<li> If it fails, it will go opposite the selected direction. Then, with a failure I will start with one pain.
</p>

<h1>Life Path</h1>
<hr>
<p>
The things to do in the life pass are as follows.
<li> Shake the dice and move the square
<li> Check scorecard
<li> Eliminate pain you have held
<li> Level up
</p>

<h2>Shake the dice and move the square</h2>
<p>
Basically this game is a game that wakes the dice, moves to the next square, and performs events occurring at that square. There are the following types of squares.
As you will be instructed to stop at each square, please follow the instructions.
<li> Angel
<li> Appreciation
<li> Blessing
<li> Depression
<li> Flash
<li> Freewill
<li> Insight
<li> Miracle
<li> Service
<li> Setback
<li> Transformation
</p>

<h2>Check scorecard</h2>
<p>
When you press the button at the top of the life path screen, the scorecard is displayed.
Each level of scorecards can be displayed.
</p>

<h2>Pain relief</h2>
<p>
As you progress through the game you will have "pain" like life. You can eliminate that pain by using "awareness" that you gained so far. <br>
When you solve it by using awareness, you will be asked how to resolve it, so please answer. <br>
</p>

<h2>Level up</h2>
<p>
"Level up" button is displayed when the level up condition is satisfied. The goal of the game is to finish the four levels, so let's up the level. <br>
Furthermore, you will not be able to level up while scorecard aware tokens, service tokens, and angel's tokens are available. Moreover, you can not level up with pain. <br>
</p>

<h1>End game</h1>
<hr>
<p>
What you do at the end of the game is as follows.
<li> Confirmation of remaining cards on unconscious envelopes
</p>

<h2>Confirmation of remaining cards on unconscious envelope</h2>
<p>
I will check the cards left on the unconscious envelope. Some cards that did not become obvious during the game may have something to do with your focus.
</p>

<h1>Difference from transformation game (board game)</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Solitaire (one person game)</h2>
<p>
It is solitaire (one person game). Although there are scenes to confess in the game, dialogue with self is the center. Because there is no other person to participate in the game, you can focus on dialogue with self. You can face the game more honestly.
</p>
<h2>No group work</h2>
<p>
Because of solitaire (one person game), there is no group insight or group set back. Everything will be handled by the player.
</p>
<h2>Logs and Notes</h2>
<p>
Because the dialogue with self is the focus, I prepared a logging function. Also, I prepared a note function that lets you freely leave comments such as awareness.
</p>
<h2>Game termination condition</h2>
<p>
It is not included in the condition to empty an unconscious envelope. It is for the simplification of the game.
</p>
<h2>At the start of the game</h2>
<p>
Both are solitaire (one person game).
<li> It will be birth without walking the source before birth.
<li> One aware notice will be given at the time of selection failure.
</p>
<h2>When selecting card after birth</h2>
<p>
If you have a card in an unconscious envelope you can always choose from both unconscious envelopes and decks.
</p>
<h2>Miracle Square</h2>
<p>
What you can do in the game is limited. It is for the simplification of the game.
</p>
<h2>Service Square</h2>
<p>
What you can do in the game is limited. It is for the simplification of the game.
