GAME OVERVIEW(Read out loud)

The Game begins with players choosing an individual Playing Focus which provides the foundation for the Game.
Players then fill their Unconscious Envelopes with various cards and are ready to play.
Each player will be born onto the Physical level, and will then receive a red Physical level Scorecard.
As you move along your Life path on the game board, you experience different Squares by following instructions on the Life square cards.
As a result you will become conscious, gain awareness, and begin to fill up your Physical level Scorecard.
Once you have mastered the Physical level and completed your red Scorecard you move to the orange Emotional level, then to the yellow Mental level, and finally to the purple level which represents the spiritual dimension.
As you move up through the levels you are concurrently emptying cards from your Unconscious Envelope, and dealing with Pain.
When you reach a point where you are free of Pain, have cleared all the cards from your Envelope and have completed all four Scorecards, your personal Game is complete.

Place it on the open square in the Source circle at the top of the Life path in front of you.
This Marker represents your identity or personality in the Game.
Take Careful note which square your Marker is on throughout the Game.

Starting with the first player, hold your Playing Focus in mind and roll the die.
Move your personality Marker the indicated number of squares around the Source circle in the direction of the arrows.
You are born and move onto your Life path by landing on any Angel square in the Source.

If your Personality Marker lands on an open square, you must remain in the Source, reflecting on your playing Focus, until your next turn to roll the die.
If your Marker lands on an occupied square, simply share that square while you wait for your next turn.
Take note of which square you are on.
If on the third die roll you do not land on an Angel square, your Guardian Angel exerts an invisible pull and you are automatically born on your fourth turn by Spiritual Caesarean!

This becomes your Guardian Angel or Game keynote.

Subsequent Angels drawn in the Game will always be placed on the lower portion of your scorecard.
STEP 4:Welcome your Guardian Angel.

If you wish, share any thoughts, feelings or impressions about your Guardian Angel with the group.

This completes your turn.
Pass the die to the next player.
On your next turn you will begin to move along your Life path following the Guidelines for play outlined below.

---------------------------
GUIDELINES FOR PLAY

If this is the first time you are playing,it is suggested that you read this section out loud when the first player is ready to move on the Life path.

You roll the die once at each turn and move along your Life Path, which winds under and over,in the direction of the arrows.
As you land on a square,find the Life square card whose picture corresponds to the particular square you have just landed on.
Follow the instructions on the back of it.

During the course of the Game you will be taking cards both from your Unconscious Envelope and Life card decks, and placing them on special areas which are indicated on your Scorecard.
Once a card is completed, place it face up on the Transformation Area on the right of your Scorecard.
This area provides a picture of your Transformation process.

You move up to the next playing level as soon as you are free of Pain on your Life Path and have completed either the upper portion of your Scorecard with 6 Awareness and 1 service Token, or the lower portion with 3 Angels.
The only exception to this is if your Marker lands on the Transformation square in the Center of your Life path.
In this case you immediately move up to the next level whether you have sufficient Tokens or not.
When you move up to the next level, your new Scorecard fits on top of your completed Scorecard covering the previous level.
Leave all your experience cards in place and simply continue moving your Marker along your life path on the new level.

Your personal Game is complete when:
1: You have cleared all the cards from your Envelope.
2: You have mastered all four playing level Scorecards.
3: And you are free of Pain.

Keep your playing Focus in mind throughout the Game and let the framework that the Game provides trigger your own creativity and deepen your understanding.
Allow the cards you draw to illuminate your playing Focus. Think about how each one relates to your issue or to your life in general.

Awareness Tokens name key words to support your growth and understanding.
Setback cards look at blockages on each level that are keeping you from achieving your focus.
Insight cards state truths that you need to remember and steps you might take to realize your goals.
Angel cards name spiritual qualities that have come to help you through your Transformation process.
Their energy is subtle but if you are open to their presence, Angels can work with you in the Game to dissolve barriers and provide genuine insight.

The whole group may decide to stop playing once one player has finished his or her personal Game, or the remaining players may wish to continue playing until everyone has completed.
At the end of the Game you can obtain a picture of your Next steps by following the instructions on page 10 when the Game is over.
Now roll the die. Have fun!

---------------------------
ENDING THE GAME

When the Game is over review all your cards on each Scorecard to get a sense of your overall Game.
Write down the text of your cards if you wish to remember the details of your game.
Then return all cards to the appropriate decks.

There are no hard and fast rules for interpreting Games.
Awareness Tokens name key words to support your growth and understanding.
Setback cards pinpoint blockages on each level that are keeping you from achieving your focus.
Insight cards state truths that you need to remember to realize your goals, and Angel cards name spiritual qualities that have come to help you through your Transformation process.
Those cards remaining in your Unconscious Envelope represent significant possibilities and unrealized potential, aspects of the Self not yet actualized and integrated in your life.

Review all your cards relative to your original playing Focus and take away Whatever message seems to fit for you personally. Your internal transformative process will not stop when the Game ends.
In the days following this Game you may find it useful to reconnect with your Guardian Angel and review your playing Cards.
Recognize how your patterns are working out and give your attention and support to those areas requiring further nurturing.
Review and record your cards now.

---------------------------
NEXT STEPS

If you want to obtain a picture of your Next steps, follow these Steps in the order given:
STEP 1: Return all the cards to the supply and shuffle the Life Angel, Life Insight and Life setback decks thoroughly.
STEP 2: Recall your Playing Focus and review how far you have come with it and the insight you have gained
Then spend a few minutes quietly looking ahead and getting in touch with your next steps.
Either use your original Playing Focus, reassessing your issue in the light of all you've learned, or choose a fresh issue that comes to mind as you look ahead.
Make a note of the focus on which you would like insight on a Next step sheet before moving on.
STEP 3:When you have written down your focus,in your own time, choose cards from the Life Insight, Life setback and Life Angel decks, as directed below, to create your Next step picture:
*Choose a Life Insight card as a key insight for your next steps.
*Choose a Life Setback card to identify an obstacle to watch out for, or a possible limitation that might set you back on your path.
*Choose a Life insight card to indicate the resource within you which can help you deal with this obstacle.
*Choose a Life Angel card to support and inspire you on your next steps.
STEP 4: Record the text of your selected cards.
Make a brief note of any realizations and commitments that you would like to put into immediate action.
If you are puzzled by any of the cards you have drawn, or if a clear message is not immediately apparent to you,let the specific text on the card move more deeply within you.
Ask your inner self to give you the conscious understanding you need over the next couple of days.
Stay open.
Reconnect with and listen to your Next step Angel and give it time and opportunity to communicate with you.
STEP 5:If you wish to,share your Next step pictures with your co-players.
Offer insights, support and feedback to one another before you pack the game away.
